# Rust Ownership Concept
In this repo, I have learned about Rust ownership concept. When dealing with complex data, Rust uses this concept to make it an optimize language that avoid unneccessary operations. The detailed information is written in `src/main.rs`.

## Running the code
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `cargo build` to install dependencies and compile the code.
3. Run `cargo run` to run it.
